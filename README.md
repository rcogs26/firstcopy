level category you want to feature. In the edit screen, upload your featured category image using the

each product.
To activate your product grid option go to your theme editor found through the Storefront Design > My

on your store to give customers the option to view products in either a grid or list view.

(description underneath images and options)
Choose the layout of your product page. The product description can go alongside the product image,
or move it underneath to focus attention on your product images.
To change the type of layout go to your theme editor found through the Storefront Design > My
Theme > Customise in your control panel. Under the Products settings, you can select the option to
show description below images under the product page heading.
Configurable Footer
Choose whether to display a simple footer, or if you have a lot of secondary pages, they can now be
easily displayed in columns. There’s also an option to display card payment providers icons in the
footer.
To activate this go to your theme editor found through the Storefront Design > My Theme > Customise
in your control panel. Under the Footer settings, you can select the option to have a simple footer. To
display the payment icons, go to the Payment Icons tab and select the payment provider icons you
wish to show on your store.
Image Hover Switcher
Show alternative product views when a customer hovers over the product image in the category grid.
This is automatically set up with the theme and will work as long as there is a second image configured
for each product you want to use the feature on. Add additional product images through the product
edit screen in your store’s control panel.
Colour Swatches on Product Grid
Quickly show your customers available colour swatches for individual products. This helps save your
customers time in looking for products.
To activate this go to your theme editor found through the Storefront Design > My Theme > Customise
in your control panel. Under Theme Features, you can enable the option to show colour swatches on
product listings.
Custom Product Labels
Create demand with attention grabbing product tags for new, best selling or reduced items easily
through your control panel.
To activate these labels go to your theme editor found through the Storefront Design > My Theme >
Customise in your control panel. Under the Labels and Tags settings, you can enable the different tags
and labels you want displaying on your store and choose the different options for each one, such as
text and label colour.
The different type of labels include:
New Products Badges
The new products tag allows you to emphasise when a new product has been added to your store. It is
automatically produced when you add the new product to your store.
Percentage Discount Badges
The percentage discount badge allows you to highlight how much percentage is off a sale item. You
can activate these in your control panel by going to Products > View > Edit Product and clicking more
pricing on the Details tab. This will show additional pricing fields and by adding a retail price along with
the normal price, this should produce a discount badge for that product.
Product Sale Badges
This badge highlights the products that are currently in the sale. They will automatically display when a
product is marked down as a sale item. If you are using percentage discount badges, we would
recommend turning Product Sale Badges off.
Custom Tags
Custom Labels help draw attention to a product to perhaps highlight its popularity, stock levels or
uniqueness. These can be activated in your control panel by going to Products > View > Edit Product
and clicking on the Custom Fields tab. In the top section, you can apply the label and what words you
would like it to display. For this to work, ‘GridTag’ must be inserted into the Name box and the chosen
text to display inserted into Value.
Out of Stock Label
Out of stock labels allow you to show when a product is out of stock in your store. This is automatically
produced if inventory levels are tracked on your store.
Selling Fast Labels
The selling fast labels alert customers to the fact stock is running low for a product. This is automatically
produced if inventory levels are tracked on your store and a stock warning amount has been set.
Configurable Newsletter Popup
Increase conversions with a newsletter popup. A newsletter subscription box will appear after your
visitor has been on your site for a defined amount of time.
